    "Just like the polynomial degree, the L2 penalty is a \"magic\" parameter we need to select. We could use the validation set approach as we did in the last module, but that approach has a major disadvantage: it leaves fewer observations available for training. **Cross-validation** seeks to overcome this issue by using all of the training set in a smart way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a kind of cross-validation called **k-fold cross-validation**. The method gets its name because it involves dividing the training set into k segments of roughtly equal size. Similar to the validation set method, we measure the validation error with one of the segments designated as the validation set. The major difference is that we repeat the process k times as follows:\n",

    "Set aside segment 0 as the validation set, and fit a model on rest of data, and evalutate it on this validation set<br>\n",
    "Set aside segment 1 as the validation set, and fit a model on rest of data, and evalutate it on this validation set<br>\n",
    "...<br>\n",
    "Set aside segment k-1 as the validation set, and fit a model on rest of data, and evalutate it on this validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process, we compute the average of the k validation errors, and use it as an estimate of the generalization error. Notice that  all observations are used for both training and validation, as we iterate over segments of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the generalization error well, it is crucial to shuffle the training data before dividing them into segments. GraphLab Create has a utility function for shuffling a given SFrame. We reserve 10% of the data as the test set and shuffle the remainder. (Make sure to use `seed=1` to get consistent answer.)"
